# The Roast Bot 9000
## This was a Hackathon Project
### Authors: Bryce Tyre, Jacob Hutchens, and Oliver Thornton

## The goal 
The point of this project was to create something that can roast people as they walk up to your door. Nobody wants those pesky neighbhors around.

## Technologies
- We used a mix of two seperate Facial recognition libraries (retinaface and backend.face_normalizer).
- We also used the Gemini API through langchain to access an llm to create the roasts.

## Challenges
- 
- It was a struggle to find which of the methods for AI Agent creation was the modern method. Langchain and that entire industry is growing so fast.
- It took a lot of attempts to get the Instructions for the AI to a point where it worked. At a couple of points, it was breraking its filter.
